- **Panda CSS** - CSS-in-JS solution with atomic CSS generation
- **React i18next** - Internationalization with French/English support
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Biome** - Code formatting and linting
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Generate CSS styles (run after modifying design tokens):

```bash
pnpm prepare
```

## Code Quality

Check code formatting and linting:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Auto-fix formatting and linting issues:

```bash
pnpm check:fix
```

Run type checking:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

## Deployment
